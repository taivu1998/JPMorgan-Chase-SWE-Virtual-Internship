# JPMorgan-Chase-SWE-Virtual-Internship

This project developed a web application as part of the JPMorgan Chase's [Software Engineering Virtual Internship](https://careers.jpmorgan.com/US/en/students/campaign/virtual-internship). Specifically, the web application provides an interactive dashboard that tracks and visualizes daily movements of stock data, thereby allowing users to devise potential trade strategies.
